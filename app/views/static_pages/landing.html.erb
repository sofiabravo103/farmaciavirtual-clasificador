<h2>Welcome <%= current_user.email %></h2>

<h4>First of all thanks for helping out! Remind me to buy you a beer sometime.</h4>
<p>To start annotating tweets click on the <strong>view datasets button</strong> bellow, find the one assigned to you and click annotate.</p>
<p>The instructions are simple: <strong>classify according to the intention of the tweet.</strong> It does not matter if the tweet is requesting hot dogs or a presidential referendum, if it requests something then classify it as requesting. Same for offering. You will find that often many tweets indicate a location in which you can find a certain drug. Again the intention is what matters, so these cases should be classified as offering. Finally when you find anything that either does not provide enough information to classify it or seems to relate to a completely different topic (such as news or thank you replies) then classify it as irrelevant. <strong>Do no be afraid to classify as irrelevant.</strong> It is a very important category. Be wary of making your decision based on key words only, for example "Todo el mundo requiere medicinas hoy en dia", would be an irrelevant tweet, regardless of the word "requiere" which would seem to be always associated with requesting.</p>

<p>Have fun! And please don't hesitate to ask when you're not sure how to classify. Venezuelans tweet weird stuff.</p>
